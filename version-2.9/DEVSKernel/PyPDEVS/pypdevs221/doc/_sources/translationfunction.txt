Translation functions
=====================

The DEVS formalism (both Classic and Parallel) allows for translation functions for:
* input to input couplings
* output to input couplings
* output to output couplings

The couplings can thus be annotated with functions that translate the actual message on it to another one.
The syntax for this annotation is by passing a function to the *connectPorts* method. 
That function will be called for every event seperatly (for Parallel DEVS: every element of the bag; for Classic DEVS: every element).

Using this functionality does not require any additional configurations.
It is important to note that using such a function will have a severe performance impact. Before calling the function, the event itself will already be coupled. After this, the translated event will again be copied.
The first copy will *always* be using the pickle method, the second copy will be the one specified by the user.
If the function does not return anything, default Python semantics will cause the function to return *None*.

Such a function can be passed to every call to *connectPorts*, be it an input-to-input, output-to-input or output-to-output connection.

The 'total translation function' will be constructed only once at the start and this composite function will be called each time.
Couplings with no translation function on them will simply copy the output to the input. 
Thus ommitting the parameter or passing *None* will have no effect.

Example
-------

A simple example is a function which translates *OutputEvent* events to *InputEvent* events::

    def translate_inputevent_to_outputevent(inputEvent):
        # For simplicity, we assume that the OutputEvent constructor
        # takes an InputEvent as its argument
        return OutputEvent(inputEvent)

To use this function on a connection::

    class MyModel(CoupledDEVS):
        def __init__(self, name):
            ...
            self.connectPorts(self.model1.outport, self.model2.inport, translate_inputevent_to_outputevent)
            ...

General python tip
------------------

It is only possible to pass a single function to the *connectPorts* call. An example is passing through an intermediate format. This is not supported by PythonPDEVS with specific syntax, as it is easy to do with Python itself using *lambda* functions. An example of this is::

    self.connectPorts(self.model1.outport, self.model2.inport, lambda i: translate_intermediate_to_output(translate_input_to_intermediate))

Of course, it is also possible to create a seperate function for this, though it could become a named function on its own.
