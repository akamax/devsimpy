# This class describes a generic method of drawing rubberbands
# on a wxPython canvas object (wxStaticBitmap, wxPanel etc) when
# the user presses the left mouse button and drags it over a rectangular
# area. It has methods to return the selected area by the user as 
# a rectangular 4 tuple / Clear the selected area.
